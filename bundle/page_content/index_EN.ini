Playing has never been enough nonetheless. What were there really behind them? <br><br> I took the first steps towards programming learning Dark Basic, a structured form of BASIC. <br><br> Because of various vicissitudes, in September 2008, I was not able to apply to a computer science oriented high school, so I chose a foreign language high school. Foreign languages were my new interest: English, French, Spanish and Latin plus German and Japanese. I also was lucky enough to go abroad and participate in various language courses in Europe. <br><br> However, after graduating in June 2013, I did not forget my old passion for programming and I applied to the university to obtain a bachelor's degree in Computer Science."
