                                Learning how to program has always been the goal of my life. It started with videogames, which I always have had an affinity with. Playing has never been enough nonetheless. What were there really behind them?
                                <br><br>
                                I took the first steps towards programming learning Dark Basic, a structured form of BASIC.
                                <br><br>
                                Because of various vicissitudes, in September 2008, I was not able to apply to a computer science oriented high school, so I chose a foreign language high school. Foreign languages were my new interest: English, French, Spanish and Latin plus German and Japanese. I also was lucky enough to go abroad and participate in various language courses in Europe.
                                <br><br>
                                However, after graduating in June 2013, I did not forget my old passion for programming and I applied to the university to obtain a bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
